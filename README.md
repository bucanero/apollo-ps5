# Apollo Save Tool (PS5)

Since people keep asking about, I want to clarify that there's **no ongoing development of a PS5 version** of Apollo Save Tool.

I've been working on my free time building Apollo Save Tool across [PS2](https://github.com/bucanero/apollo-ps2), [PS3](https://github.com/bucanero/apollo-ps3), [PS4](https://github.com/bucanero/apollo-ps4), [PSP](https://github.com/bucanero/apollo-psp), and [PS Vita](https://github.com/bucanero/apollo-vita) platforms for over 5 years, and the support from the community has been always close to **zero**.

If people want me to evaluate any requests about a PS5 version, start by supporting my projects.

The more monetary support I have, the less likely I am to pick up more paying work for myself, and the more free time I have to work on my PlayStation homebrew hobby.
